      <h1 id="name-id">Hi, I'm Puja!</h1>
      <p>Currently a student at Ada Developers Academy Cohort 18! 
        I am a strong willed, independent and creative problem solver. 
        I thrive in situations that require problem solving by getting to know the "why" behind things and diving deep to find out the root cause. 
        Iâ€™m expanding my career into programming to better suit my love for problem solving and continual growth. 
        Being in the banking and customer service industry for almost 5 years, I have been instrumental in establishing trust, confidence and long term relationship with numerous customers by managing expectations. 
        I believe my experience of working in a high volume, fast paced banking and customer service industry and being a team leader will help me grow and succeed in the software industry.
